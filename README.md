Activiti Process Assertions
===========================

This library provides an easy way to perform checks on expected JUnit test results when testing BPMN processes with the Activiti framework. Instead of coding the checks against Activiti's API, you perform simple functional assertions as you would with other JUnit tests. For instance, you often wish to check whether a process has been started, it is waiting in a UserTask or has reached a certain end state.

Take the example of checking whether a process has been started. When testing a BPMN process definition with Activiti, you typically start a process instance by invoking one of the RuntimeService's start methods, hold a reference to the ProcessInstance it returns and then query the RuntimeService with that instance's id to see whether the process is still running (assuming the process reaches a wait state before completing). Starting the process will remain a part of your unit test, but performing the checks is a repetitive piece of code that clogs up the rest of your test code. Checking whether a process is started is a simple check, but some checks require quite a couple of lines to make sure everything is OK. Process assertions save you the time of writing these checks and make your unit test easier to understand.
